# PCBCTB
THIS PROJECT IS NOT CURRENTLY USEABLE

This project would not be possible without the reverse engineering efforts of [Cliff L. Biffle](https://github.com/cbiffle) available [here](https://github.com/cbiffle/catibo/blob/master/doc/cbddlp-ctb.adoc)

PCBCTB is a project to produce ctb files from pcb data. Not sure how exactly how I want to do this. SVG from kicad, PNG from SVG from kicad, kicad plugin of some kind, etc.
